Project Overview
This repository contains the data analysis and machine learning models developed to analyze Formula 1 racing strategies, with a focus on predictive outcomes and strategic recommendations for constructor teams. The project utilizes various datasets encapsulated in CSV format, including detailed race data that serves as the backbone for our Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, and Random Forest models.

Models and Analysis
Gradient Boosting Model: Employed to understand the nuances of Formula 1 race strategies and their impact on race outcomes. The model uses historical data to highlight the importance of various strategic elements, such as pit stops and tire selection.
Linear Regression Model: Applied to investigate the relationship between qualifying positions and final race placements, allowing us to discern trends and patterns that affect race performance.
Random Forest Model: Referred to in the context of this project as the "Rain Forest" model, it delves into race data with particular attention to weather conditions, tire usage, and pit stop timing. The insights from this model are crucial for formulating strategic recommendations.
Data
The CSV files used in this project contain historical race data, including lap times, tire choices, pit stop timings, and weather conditions. The datasets were sourced from publicly available Formula 1 statistics and telemetry data.

Predictive Use
The models are designed to predict race outcomes and provide strategic insights, such as:

Optimal tire strategies under different weather conditions and track types.
Ideal number and timing of pit stops for various race scenarios.
Potential race positions based on qualifying times and historical data.
Strategic Recommendations
Based on the model outcomes, we provide data-driven strategic recommendations to constructor teams, aiding them in decision-making processes related to race strategy formulation.
